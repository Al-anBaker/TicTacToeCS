#Tic Tac Toe Csharp

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game based in a Csharp console, it is ported from a Python version built in 2023.

The Game allows each player to pick a Symbol or a string as their 'Token' for the game, It only has Local Multiplayer with two people, and no single player gameplay yet.

Code is commented to the best of my ability, but im rather new so its not great.
